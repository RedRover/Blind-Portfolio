#PSY 441 Capstone Project 

###Stacie Heiberg

The data, analyses, images, and presentations all represent a reproducible example of an experiment involving change blindness. The data come from my
[Change Blindnesshttps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lT596YOX0). They
were processed and analyzed in R. Results of these analyses were written up
in a poster for my senior capstone Psychology 441 class at Eastern Oregon University.
