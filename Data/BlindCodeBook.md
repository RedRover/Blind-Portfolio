#Codebook for results.csv

The data in results.csv represent my data for my Psychology 441 Capstone Project. Participants emailed me their results after participating in my expriment that was found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0lT596YOX0. No compensation was offered for participation with the exception of extra credit in some EOU Psychology courses.The data was saved input into an Excel file and then saved as a .csv file compatable with R Studio. The data was saved in results.csv and combined using the preprocessing.R.The R script in results.csv is sitable for analysis.

The data file includes 2 variables.

* **Condition**: The condition participants participated in. The condition determined
which video the participant viewed, or which emotion the participant was meant to experience. Participants selected their condition based on the current time they were to begin the experiment. Participants reported which condition they were in by emailing the researcher, along with their experiment resuts.

If the time was even (630) the participant was in condition one(happy). If the time was odd (631) the participant was in condition 2 (sad).
Participants then viewed a change blindness video, where they would indicate whether or not they saw a change in the video.

Few participants noted a change, and a few particpants noted a change that did not happen.

 These data will not be analyzed further.
