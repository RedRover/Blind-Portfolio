First, I input my data in Microsoft Excel, and saved the file as a .csv file.I then loaded the csv file.
```{r}
results<-read.csv("results.csv")

```
Here I check the structure of my results to make sure the results are what I wanted them to look like. 
```{r}
str(results)
```
I then make a table and run a Chi-squared test. The Chi-squared tests tells me my p-value, degrees of freedom, and my x squared
```{r}
table(results$Condition,results$Change)
chisq.test(results$Condition,results$Change)
```
